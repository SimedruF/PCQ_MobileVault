# Run the application
flutter run
```

## üîí Security and Privacy

### Security Principles
- **Zero-knowledge**: Passwords are not stored in plain text
- **Local encryption**: All data is encrypted locally
- **No cloud**: Data remains on user's device
- **Open-source audit**: Code is available for verification

### Important Considerations
- **Backups**: Backup keys regularly
- **Strong passwords**: Use passwords of at least 12 characters
- **Updates**: Keep the application up to date
- **Device security**: Use screen locking
